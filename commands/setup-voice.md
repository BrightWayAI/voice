# /setup-voice

One-time voice bootstrap. Captures the writing-voice rules every drafting plugin needs and writes them to the private canonical voice file under the resolved config root.

After this runs, every drafting plugin reads voice from this file. You update voice in one place, every drafter benefits.

---

## Step 0 — Resolve plugin config root

Resolve `<config-root>` through explicit override → `CORTEX_CONFIG_ROOT` →
`~/.cortex/config-root` → legacy pointer → default. A malformed higher-priority
pointer is an error. Request access only to the resolved directory.

If an intentional root already resolves, continue to Step 1. Otherwise continue to
first-time bootstrap.

### First-time bootstrap

The pointer doesn't exist, so this is the user's first plugin setup of any kind. Prompt:

> "First-time Nucleus setup. Where should the shared config root live? Pick a folder you control (for example `~/Documents/Cortex/`). It will contain private identity/voice files under `memory/me/`, shared memory nodes, and a `plugins/` settings directory."

Once the user provides the path:

1. Ensure access to `<path>`. If running in Cowork and the folder isn't already mounted in this session, call `request_cowork_directory(<path>)`. If running in Claude Code or another environment with direct filesystem access, no mount call is needed — proceed to read or write the file.
2. Create `<path>/plugins/` if it doesn't exist.
3. Atomically write the absolute path to `~/.cortex/config-root`; replacing a
   different target requires a second explicit confirmation.
4. Confirm: "Saved. All Nucleus hosts and plugins will resolve `<path>` from the vendor-neutral Cortex pointer."

For the rest of this document, **`<voice-path>`** refers to `<config-root>/memory/me/voice.md`.

---

## Step 1 — Check for existing voice config

Read `<voice-path>` if it exists.

- **Populated** → ask: "Voice already captured. Update specific sections, or start over?"
  - "Update [section]" → jump there.
  - "Start over" → continue full interview.
- **Missing** → start fresh.

---

## Step 2 — The interview

One section at a time. Confirm before moving on. This interview takes 5–7 minutes if you have your bearings.

### Section 1 — Voice descriptors

- **Three words** that describe how you want your writing to sound. Examples: "warm, direct, low-jargon" / "contrarian, sharp, plainspoken" / "calm, specific, generous." If you can only think of two, that's fine. Don't pick more than four — descriptors lose meaning past four.
- **One word you're consciously NOT** — what's the trap you're trying to avoid? (e.g., "salesy," "academic," "preachy.")

### Section 2 — Banned phrases

The marketplace ships with a default banned list (see below). Adopt it as your starting point, then add/remove.

**Default banned list:**
- "just checking in"
- "circling back"
- "touching base"
- "I hope this email finds you well"
- "per my last email"
- "at your earliest convenience"
- "synergy" / "leverage" (verb) / "align" / "delight" / "move the needle"
- "to whom it may concern"
- "would love to pick your brain"
- "let me know if you have any questions"

Ask:
- Any of these you actually like and want to keep? (Strike them from your list.)
- Any phrases beyond this list that you ban for yourself? (Add them.)

### Section 3 — Sentence length and rhythm

- **Length preference** — short and punchy / mixed / longer-form?
- **Paragraphs** — do you prefer single-line paragraphs (LinkedIn-style) or denser prose paragraphs?
- **Em-dashes, colons, parentheticals** — do you use them often, occasionally, or avoid them?

### Section 4 — Hook patterns

For posts and outbound openers, what hook style lands for you?

- **Contrarian** — challenge a common assumption with evidence
- **Observation** — name a pattern most people haven't connected
- **Prediction** — extrapolate where things point
- **Question** — pose a real question, then answer it
- **Story** — short anecdote that earns the point

Pick your top 1–2 patterns. Note any you actively want to AVOID (often "story" doesn't fit B2B operators; "contrarian" can feel exhausting if overused).

### Section 5 — Sign-off, signature, CTAs

- **How do you typically sign emails?** ("— [name]" / "Best, [name]" / no sign-off / etc.)
- **CTA style** — what do you reach for at the end of an outbound message? (e.g., "worth a 15-minute call?" / "want me to send the teardown?" / "open to a quick thread?")
- **Hashtags** — for LinkedIn posts: preferred set (or "no hashtags") and max count

### Section 6 — Voice exemplars (optional but powerful)

If you have 1–3 short writing samples you'd point to as "this is exactly the voice I want to hit," paste them or link them. The drafters read these to calibrate.

If you don't have exemplars handy, skip this section. You can add them later by editing `<voice-path>` directly.

---

## Step 3 — Write the voice file

Populate `<voice-path>` using this exact structure (every drafter parses it):

```markdown
# Writing Voice

_Last updated: [today]_
_Created by /setup-voice (Comms Desk plugin; written to a Cortex-owned canonical file)_

## Voice descriptors
- **Three words:** ...
- **NOT this:** ...

## Banned phrases
- [bullet list — copy from defaults, then add/remove per the interview]

## Sentence length and rhythm
- **Length:** [short / mixed / longer]
- **Paragraphs:** [single-line / dense]
- **Em-dashes / colons / parentheticals:** [often / occasionally / avoid]

## Hook patterns
- **Preferred:** [1–2 styles]
- **Avoid:** [any styles to skip]

## Sign-off and CTAs
- **Sign-off:** ...
- **CTA style:** ...
- **Hashtags:** [preferred set, or "no hashtags"]

## Exemplars
[paste or link 1–3 voice exemplars here, or "none yet"]
```

---

## Step 3.5 — Wire voice into user.md graph (v4.12.0+)

After voice.md is written, ensure `<config-root>/memory/me/user.md` has a wikilink to `[[voice]]` in its Canonical Files section. Without this link, voice.md is an orphan in the Obsidian graph view.

Logic:
1. Check whether `<config-root>/memory/me/user.md` exists. If not, skip — cortex's first `/remember` will create it with proper canonical-file references.
2. Read `<config-root>/memory/me/user.md`.
3. Check whether `[[voice]]` is already present anywhere in the file. If yes, skip (idempotent).
4. Look for a `## Canonical Files` section header in user.md.
   - **If found**: append `- [[voice]] — writing voice descriptors, banned phrases, sign-off, hook patterns` as a bullet under it.
   - **If not found**: insert a new section right before the first existing `##` heading:
     ```
     ## Canonical Files
     - [[voice]] — writing voice descriptors, banned phrases, sign-off, hook patterns
     ```
5. Write user.md back.

Symmetric note: `/setup-identity` Step 3.7 does the same for `[[identity]]`. Both are idempotent. The end state: `user.md` Canonical Files section links to the canonical private profile files so Obsidian's graph view shows the connections.

**Why this matters:** `voice.md` lives under the private `memory/me/` scope,
which the shared-memory index and relinker intentionally exclude. `/setup-voice`
is therefore responsible for wiring the link.

No user gate. Best-effort — if user.md doesn't exist or the write fails, log and continue.

---

## Step 4 — Confirm and offer next step

Summarize what was saved (one short paragraph). Then offer:

> "Voice saved to `<voice-path>`. Growth, Clients, Research, Comms, and Today's Brief will read it automatically. Update anytime by re-running `/setup-voice` or editing `<voice-path>` directly."

---

## Behavior rules

- One section at a time. Don't bombard.
- The interview should feel like talking to an editor who's about to ghostwrite for you. Not a form.
- Idempotent. Re-running updates existing sections.
- The file lives at `<voice-path>` — wherever the plugin config root points (or the legacy default).

## What this is NOT for

- Plugin-specific voice rules (for example, Growth touchpoint length) stay in plugin-specific settings. The shared voice file is for global-to-you rules.
- Tonal customization per audience or per channel — that's drafting-time logic. The shared voice.md captures *your default voice*; specific situations adjust.
